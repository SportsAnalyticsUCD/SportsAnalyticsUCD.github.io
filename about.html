            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>The Sports Analytics Club at UC Davis’s (SACUCD) mission is to be the connection between Sports and Computer Science and give members an opportunity to combine their personal hobbies with their academic interests. We plan on analyzing sport’s data, specifically the NFL and NBA, to create models that can evaluate individual and team performances and eventually  predict fantasy football points. Through our data analysis and compilation, we hope to create new statistical perspectives in the world of sports and communicate the findings through journalism.
